## Installation

As you always do, install composer package:

```bash
composer require adminarchitect/core
```

### Registering 
_[Skip for Laravel 5.5]_

Once the package installed, register its service provider in config/app.php file.

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Terranet\Administrator\ServiceProvider::class,
	...
]
```
### Publishing

Publish package's assets, translation and configuration by running:

```bash
php artisan administrator:publish
```
Answer few questions about configuration steps.
It will copy adminarchitect's assets to a resources/assets/administrator directory.
All views will be copied to a resources/views/vendor/administrator directory.

### Assets
AdminArchitect assets are provided in ES6 and less/sass formats, so to convert them to a js/css there is a NPM package adminarchitect/mix.

First we need to do is to install node dependencies (if you didn't do this before) by runing:

```bash
npm i
```

then let's install adminarchitect-mix:

```bash
npm i adminarchitect/mix --save-dev
```

Next step is to register AdminMix tasks, so add these lines to your webpack.mix.js:

```js
const AdminMix = require('adminarchitect-mix');
(new AdminMix).handle();
```

then you can run any of these commands, to build assets:
```bash
npm run [dev|production|watch]
```

All generated assets will be placed to `public/admin` directory.

### Migrations
if you're running a fresh Laravel installation, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Create administrator

Now let's create a new administrator account:

```bash
php artisan administrator:create
```
